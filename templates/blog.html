            <p>To differentiate between bilingual and monolingual listeners a deep neural network-based model was proposed in a recent work. Where the authors 
                implemented Classification and regression trees (CART), Logistic Regression (LR), also Naive Bayes (NB), Support vector machine (SVM), and 
                Naive Bayes (NB) and analyzed the participants' behavioral pattern to improve the measurement accuracy. Though the performance of the proposed 
                deep neural network may fluctuate when applied to a larger dataset...<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7080/9/3/51">continue reading</a>

            <p>In [8] Park et al. used CNN (with two types of image filters) to increase noise classification rate and DNN to improve the noise reduction 
                performance. Using deep learning approaches proposed a speech enhancement algorithm considering the environmental noises as hearing aids 
                operate in such situations and enhance the speech quality. For advanced hearing aid chips and speech signal processing more complex 
                algorithms could be applied to the hearing aids. Detailed hearing compensation could be provided to the diverse characteristics of hearing...<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/17/6077">continue reading</a>

            <p>In another work [3] Hout et al. shows, using the stimulus reconstruction method, an objective measure of brain processing of the speech envelope was 
                created, and it was compared to behaviorally evaluated speech intelligibility. The authors used the ideal parameters and compared them to the behavioral 
                SRT and by calculating the correlation between the actual speech envelope and the reconstructed envelope for each SNR. There was a gap in knowledge 
                between the electrophysiological and behavioral approaches of hearing evaluation. The behavioral approaches can produce an accurate estimate of speech 
                intelligibility but suffer from a number of confounding effects...<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29464412/">continue reading</a>
